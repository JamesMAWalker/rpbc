## ROOTS - Plantbased Caf√©

This responsive web app was built for ROOTS, a plantbased restaurant in central Vietnam. The project uses a combination of the GloriaFood CMS/API and Shipday to allow customers to place orders, and to allow Roots to fulfill them. Uses an Express server to connect the React/Vite front-end with the aforementioned APIs.
